I am a senior postdoc with a background in electrical/biomedical engineering and computer engineering. Currently I work at the [Educational Neuroscience group](https://psychologie.uni-graz.at/en/educational-neuroscience/) at the [Institute of Psychology](https://psychologie.uni-graz.at/en/), [University of Graz](https://www.uni-graz.at/en/), Austria.

I am interested in neuroscientific substrates of number processing and arithmetic, EEG oscillations and connectivity analysis, biomedical signal processing, applied machine learning and statistics, brain-computer interfaces, and software development. I am a big fan of open source software and I believe that science should be open as well, including data and analysis scripts. [Python](https://www.python.org/) is my favorite language, but I also enjoy performing data analysis and statistical tests with [R](https://www.r-project.org/) (thanks in particular to its awesome [Tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/)). [Julia](https://julialang.org/) also looks super interesting, but it's not quite ready yet for me.

I maintain and develop [MNELAB](https://github.com/cbrnr/mnelab) (a graphical user interface for processing EEG/MEG data using [MNE](https://mne.tools)), the Qt/C++ based biosignal visualization tool [SigViewer](https://github.com/cbrnr/sigviewer), [SCoT](https://github.com/scot-dev/scot) (a Python package for EEG-based source connectivity estimation), and [XDF.jl](https://github.com/cbrnr/XDF.jl) (a Julia package for reading [XDF](https://github.com/sccn/xdf/wiki/Specifications) files). I am part of the [MNE](https://martinos.org/mne/stable/index.html) and [pyXDF](https://github.com/xdf-modules/xdf-Python) development teams, and I have contributed to numerous open source projects such as [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/), [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/), [PsychoPy](http://www.psychopy.org/), [SciPy](https://www.scipy.org/), [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/), [pybv](https://github.com/bids-standard/pybv), and [BioSig](http://biosig.sourceforge.net/) (check out my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/cbrnr) for a detailed activity summary).
